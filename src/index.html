              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
              from their experiences was easy.

              the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
              developer.
              The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community

              “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
              professionals
              who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
              who
              can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
              I’ve
              often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
              land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
